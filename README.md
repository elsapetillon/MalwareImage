# From image to malware

Malwares (malicious software) represent a category of software specifically designed to harm or exploit computer systems, networks, and users. The term includes a wide range of malicious programs, including viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, and more. The presence and activities of malware pose significant challenges and consequences for individuals and/or organizations.

Malwares can lead to data theft, financial loss, system disruption, privacy violations and network exploitation which are all critical threats to people or systems. Malware authors constantly evolve their tactics to bypass traditional security measures. This includes employing polymorphic techniques to change their appearance, using obfuscation to hide their true intent, and leveraging zero-day vulnerabilities to exploit systems before patches are available. Modern malware often exhibits stealthy behavior to avoid detection. This includes disguising its presence, encrypting communication with command-and-control servers, and employing anti-analysis techniques to prevent detection from security researchers.

Many solutions already exist to detect malwares such as signature-based detection, heuristics or behavioral analysis. However, Traditional signature-based detection relies on identifying known patterns or signatures of malware. This method is less effective against new and previously unseen malware variants, making it challenging to keep up with the rapidly evolving threat landscape.
